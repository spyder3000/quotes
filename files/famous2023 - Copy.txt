"I suspect the truth is that we are waiting, all of us, against insurmountable odds, for something extraordinary to happen to us." | Khaled Hosseini (And the Mountains Echoed) ++1
It's a funny thing... but people mostly have it backward.  They think they live by what they want.  But really, what guides them is what they're afraid of.  What they don't want. | Khaled Hosseini (And the Mountains Echoed) ++1
I don't know what this feather means, the story of it, but I know it means he was thinking of me.  For all these years.  He remembered me. | Khaled Hosseini (And the Mountains Echoed) ++1
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing, there is a field.  I'll meet you there.  | Khaled Hosseini, (And the Mountains Echoed)

Every hour, she thinks, someone for whom the war was memory falls out of the world.  | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See)
I have been feeling very clearheaded lately and what I want to write about today is the sea....  It is my favorite thing, I think, that I have ever seen.  Sometimes I catch myself staring at it and forget my duties.  It seems big enough to contain everything anyone could ever feel. | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See) ++2
To shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See)

It was hard to live through the early 1940s in France and not have the war be the center from which the rest of your life spiraled.| Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See) ++1
Everything is glory and country and competition and sacrifice.  Live faithfully, the boys sing as they troop past the edges of the colony.  Fight bravely and die laughing | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See) ++1
Out of loudspeakers all around Zollverein, the staccato voice of the Reich grows like some imperturbable tree; its subjects lean toward its branches as if toward the lips of God.  And when God stops whispering, they become desperate for someone who can put things right. | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See) ++2
It's 1940 and no one laughs at the Hitler Youth now. | Anthony Doerr (All the Light We Cannot See)

"He needs to be corrected, if you don't mind me saying so.  He needs a good talking-to, and perhaps a bit more." | Delbert Grady (The Shining) 
"My own girls, sir, didn't care for the Overlook at first.  One of them actually stole a pack of my matches and tried to burn it down.  I corrected them.  I corrected them most harshly.  And when my wife tried to stop me from doing my duty, I corrected her."  | Delbert Grady (The Shining)   ++2

You learn nothing about men by snubbing them and crushing their pride. You must ask them what it is they can do in this world, that they alone can do.  | Hilary Mantel (Wolf Hall)  ++1
He thinks, I remembered you, Thomas More, but you didn't remember me.  You never even saw me coming. | Hilary Mantel  (Wolf Hall)
A man's power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face.  It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires. | Hilary Mantel (Wolf Hall) ++2
No ruler in the history of the world has ever been able to afford a war.  They're not affordable things.  No prince ever says, 'This is my budget, so this is the kind of war I can have.'  | Hilary Mantel (Wolf Hall) ++1

Why does everything you know, and everything you've learned, confirm you in what you believed before?  Whereas in my case, what I grew up with, and what I thought I believed, is chipped away a little and a little, a fragment then a piece and then a piece more. | Hilary Mantel (Wolf Hall)  ++2
With every month that passes, the corners are knocked off the certainties of this world: and the next world too.  | Hilary Mantel (Wolf Hall)  

When you die it's the same as if everybody else did too.   | Cormac McCarthy (The Road)

When your dreams are of some world that never was or of some world that never will be and you are happy again then you will have given up.  | Cormac McCarthy (The Road) ++1
 
No golem has ever existed that did not eventually run amok.  You must be prepared to destroy her.  | Helene Wecker  (The Golem and the Jinni)
He'd lived so long in anticipation of his own death that to contemplate his future was like standing at the edge of a cliff, staring into a vertiginous rush of open sky.  | Helene Wecker  (The Golem and the Jinni) ++1
If he could pick a moment to be taken into the flask, a moment to live in endlessly, perhaps he would choose this one: the passing city, and the woman at his side. | Helene Wecker  (The Golem and the Jinni) ++1
The tide of her exhilaration drained from her, leaving her exhausted and heartsick.  She would have bound the entire city, made them all into her golems, to satisfy her own need to be useful. | Helene Wecker (The Golem and the Jinni) ++1

"To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world.  That's what everybody does every hour of his life.  If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that's much harder?" | Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead) ++1
"Self-sacrifice?  But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed."  |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead)
Thousands of years ago the first man discovered how to make fire.  He was probably burnt at the stake he'd taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived and he lifted darkness from the face of the Earth.  |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead)  ++2
"I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life.  Nor to any part of my energy.  Nor to any achievement of mine.  No matter who makes the claim, how large their number or how great their need." |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead) ++2
"I take the only desire one can really permit oneself.  Freedom, Alvah, freedom...  To ask nothing.  To expect nothing.  To depend on nothing."  |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead) ++1
The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident which everybody has decided not to see.  |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead)
People want nothing but mirrors around them.  To reflect them while they're reflecting too.  You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage. |  Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead) ++1

Maybe you didn't understand American foreign policy or why we were at war.  Maybe you never will.  But it doesn't matter.  You held up your hand and said, "I'm willing to die for these worthless civilians." | Phil Klay (Redeployment) ++1
"She spent all his combat pay before he got back, and she was five months pregnant, which, for a Marine coming back from a seven-month deployment, is not pregnant enough." | Phil Klay (Redeployment) ++1
"Getting back feels like your first breath after nearly drowning.  Even if it hurts, it's good."   | Phil Klay, Redeployment
We shot dogs.  Not by accident.  We did it on purpose, and we called it Operation Scooby.  I'm a dog person, so I thought about that a lot.  | Phil Klay (Redeployment) ++1
And yet, I have this sense that this place is holier than back home....  At least here, Rodriguez has the decency to worry about hell.  |  Phil Klay (Redeployment) ++1

We like companionship, see, but we can't stand to be around people for very long.  So we go get ourselves lost, come back for a while, then get the hell out again.  | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
It is true that I miss intelligent companionship, but there are so few with whom I can share the things that mean so much to me that I have learned to contain myself.  It is enough that I am surrounded with beauty.  | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
I think maybe part of what got him into trouble was that he did too much thinking.  Sometimes he tried too hard to make sense of the world, to figure out why people were bad to each other so often.   | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
And I also know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong.  To measure yourself at least once.  To find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions.  | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
Nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.  The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
He did a lot of socializing.  Sometimes I think it was like he was storing up company for the times when he knew nobody would be around. | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
If you don't take it, I'm going to throw it away....  I don't want to know what time it is.  I don't want to know what day it is or where I am.  None of that matters. | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1
Alaska has long been a magnet for dreamers and misfits, people who think the unsullied enormity of the Last Frontier will patch all the holes in their lives. | Jon Krakauer (Into the Wild) ++1

My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops? | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)

I believe there is another world waiting for us.  A better world.  And I'll be waiting for you there. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)
Cowardice is nothing to do with it - suicide takes considerable courage.  Japanese have the right idea.  No, what's selfish is to demand another to endure an intolerable existence, just to spare families, friends, and enemies a bit of soul-searching. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++2
Fantasy.  Lunacy.  All revolutions are, until they happen, then they are historical inevitabilities. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)
What wouldn't I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable?  To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
Why does any martyr cooperate with his judases?...  We see a game beyond the endgame...  As Seneca warned Nero: No matter how many of us you kill, you will never kill your successor. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
Behold your future, Cavendish the Younger.  You will not apply for membership, but the tribe of the elderly will claim you. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
Don't bemoan your misspent life quite yet.  Forgive me for flaunting my experience, but you have no conception of what a misspent life constitutes. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, and though a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud and so is a soul. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
Sobering to think how one accursed night of baccarat can alter a man's social standing so irreversibly. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)
The most humiliating thing you can do to a man is to save his life. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)
An abyss cannot be crossed in two steps. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)

Torturous advances won over generations can be lost by a single stroke of a myopic president's pen or a vainglorious general's sword. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)
You can maintain power over people, as long as you give them something.  Rob a man of everything, and that man will no longer be in your power. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas) ++1
She has to lose her pre-Copernican view of a universe revolving around herself. | David Mitchell (Cloud Atlas)

It's all fine to say, "Time will heal everything, this too shall pass away.  People will forget" and things like that when you are not involved, but when you are, there is no passage of time, people do not forget and you are in the middle of something that does not change. | John Steinbeck (Cannery Row) ++2
If a man ordered a beer milkshake he'd better do it in a town where he wasn't known.  | John Steinbeck (Cannery Row)

They could ruin their lives and get money....  They're all very clever if they want something.  They just know the nature of things too well to be caught in wanting.| John Steinbeck (Cannery Row) ++1

It's exactly at these moments, when all hope has vanished, that prayer has dominion. | Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) 
"But this isn't human! When has this country ever been human, Abelard? You're the historian. You of all people should know that."  | Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao)  ++1

"Shot at twenty-seven times - what a Dominican number..." | Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao)
But folks always underestimate what the promise of a lifetime of starvation, powerlessness, and humiliation can provoke in a young person's character. | Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) ++1
There it was, the decision that changed everything.... All I wanted was to dance.  What I got instead was "esto", she said, opening her arms to encompass the hospital, her children, her cancer, America. | Junot Díaz (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) ++1

I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me....  I am anything that happens after I'm gone which would not have happened if I had not come. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)  ++1
Most of what matters in our lives takes place in our absence. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)

Where, then, is optimism?  In fate or in chaos? | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children) 
For every snake, there is a ladder; for every ladder, a snake. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children) 
I fell victim to the temptation of every autobiographer, to the illusion that since the past exists only in one's memories and the words which strive vainly to encapsulate them, it is possible to create past events simply by saying they occurred.  | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)   ++2
...in autobiography, as in all literature, what actually happened is less important than what the author can manage to persuade his audience to believe. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)   ++1
Why, alone of all the more-than-five-hundred-million, should I have to bear the burden of history? | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)  
Reality is a question of perspective; the further you get from the past, the more concrete and plausible it seems - but as you approach the present, it inevitably seems more and more incredible. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)  ++1
...because it is the privilege and the curse of midnight's children to be both masters and victims of their times, to forsake privacy and be sucked into the annihilating whirlpool of the multitudes, and to be unable to live or die in peace. | Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children)  ++2

Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this son of York|Richard (from Richard III)

We all have such fateful objects -- it may be a recurrent landscape in one case, a number in another -- carefully chosen by the gods to attract events of specific significance for us: here shall John always stumble; there shall Jane's heart always break. | Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita) ++2
Life is just one small piece of light between two eternal darknesses. | Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita)
Imagine me; I shall not exist if you do not imagine me; try to discern the doe in me, trembling in the forest of my own iniquity; let's even smile a little. After all, there is no harm in smiling. | Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita) ++1
And the most poignant thing was not Lolita's absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from the chorus. | Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita)

Nobody exists on purpose.  Nobody belongs anywhere.  We're all going to die.  Come watch TV.  | Morty (from Rick & Morty)
Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

Focus on science. | Rick (from Rick & Morty) ++2
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?  The answer is:  Don't think about it. | Rick (from Rick & Morty)

I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner. | Rick (from Rick & Morty)

Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only -- if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things -- beautiful things -- that they connect you to some larger beauty? | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch) ++1
We don't get to choose our own hearts.  We can't make ourselves want what's good for us or what's good for other people.  We don't get to choose the people we are. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again.  You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
We can't choose what we want and don't want and that's the hard lonely truth.  Sometimes we want what we want even if we know it's going to kill us. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
To understand the world at all, sometimes you could only focus on a tiny bit of it, look very hard at what was close to hand and make it stand in for the whole | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
We are so customed to disguise ourselves to others that, in the end, we become disguised to ourselves. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
Only occasionally did I notice the chain on the finch's ankle, or think what a cruel life for a little living creature -- fluttering briefly, forced always to land in the same hopeless place.| Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
The sky was a rich, mindless, never-ending blue, like a promise of some ridiculous glory that wasn't really there.| Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch)
It was rotten top to bottom.  Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned peaches at the nursing home. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch) ++1
I don't care what anyone says or how often or winningly they say it: no one will ever, ever be able to persuade me that life is some awesome, rewarding treat.  Because, here's the truth: life is catastrophe. | Donna Tartt (The Goldfinch) ++1
Been beat up and battered 'round, Been sent up, and I've been shot down, You're the best thing that I've ever found, Handle me with care  | Traveling Wilburys (Handle With Care)  
Been stuck in airports, terrorized, Sent to meetings, hypnotized, Overexposed, commercialized, Handle me with care | Traveling Wilburys (Handle With Care)

Airports say work and security checks and delays.  Ports say...  I don't know.  Something completely different.  Escape, maybe. | Ruth Ware (The Woman in Cabin 10) 
There's a reason why we keep thoughts inside our heads for the most part -- they're not safe to be let out in public. | Ruth Ware (The Woman in Cabin 10) 

And the young people ask "What are they marching for?"  And I ask myself the same question.  | Eric Bogle (And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda)
But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, And the old men still answer the call, But year after year, the numbers get fewer, Someday, no one will march there at all. | Eric Bogle (And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda) 
But the Band played Waltzing Matilda, As they carried us down the gangway, But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, Then they turned all their faces away.  | Eric Bogle (And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda) 
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda.  Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?  And their ghosts can be heard as they march by the billibong, Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me? | Eric Bogle (And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda) ++1
And the band played Waltzing Matilda, As we stopped to bury our slain, and we buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, Then we started all over again. | Eric Bogle (And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda)
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong, Under the shade of a coolibah tree, He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled, You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me |Slim Dusty (Waltzing Matilda)

Only the dead have seen the end of war  | Plato
People seemed to believe that technology had stripped hurricanes of their power to kill.  No hurricane expert endorsed this view.  | Erik Larson (Isaac's Storm)

The bureau had long banned the use of the word tornado because it induced panic, and panic brought criticism, something the bureau could ill afford.| Erik Larson (Isaac's Storm) 
Some critics argued men should not try to predict the weather, because it was God's province; others that men could not predict the weather, because men were incompetent.| Erik Larson (Isaac's Storm)

But if you cannot speak truth at a beheading, when can you speak it? | Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
That's the point of a promise, he thinks.  It wouldn't have any value, if you could see what it would cost you when you made it. | Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
This is what life does for you in the end; it arranges a fight you can't win. | Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
If you marvel at your good fortune, you should marvel in secret: never let people see you. | Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
No.  I am not sad.  I am not allowed to be.  I am too useful to be sad.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
Everybody wants something, if only for the pain to stop.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
But the law is not an instrument to find out truth.  It is there to create a fiction that will help us move past atrocious act and face our future. | Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
It seems there is no mercy in this world, but a kind of haphazard justice: men pay for crimes, but not necessarily their own.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
Never enter a contest of wills with the king.  Do not flatter him.  Instead, give him something he can take credit for.  Ask him questions to which you know the answers.  Do not ask him the other sort of question.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light) ++1
Wolsey always said, work out what people want, and you might be able to offer it; it is not always what you think, and may be cheap to supply.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
If kings do not see you, they forget you.  Even though nothing in the realm is done without you, kings think they do it all themselves.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
It is not written that great men shall be happy men.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
If a man should live as if every day is his last, he should also die as if there is a day to come, and another after that.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)

They say Cain invented cities.  And if it was not he, it was someone else fond of murder.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)
He who climbs higher than he should, falls lower than he would.| Hilary Mantel (The Mirror & the Light)

Nobody feels any pain, Tonight as I stand inside the rain  | Bob Dylan (Just Like a Woman)

I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin', I saw a white ladder all covered with water, I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken, I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children | Bob Dylan (A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall) ++1
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest, Where the people are many and their hands are all empty | Bob Dylan (A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall)

The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain, And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain | Bob Dylan (Visions of Johanna) 

Got on a lucky one, Came in eighteen to one;  I've got a feeling This year's for me and you.  So happy Christmas, I love you baby.  I can see a better time When all our dreams come true  | The Pogues (Fairytale of New York) ++1
I could have been someone / Well so could anyone   | The Pogues (Fairytale of New York)   
You took my dreams from me, When I first found you.  I kept them with me babe, I put them with my own.  Can't make it all alone,  I've built my dreams around you.  | The Pogues (Fairytale of New York)  
We walked him to the station in the rain, We kissed him as we put him on the train.  And we sang him a song of times long gone, Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again.   | The Pogues (Sally MacLennane)  
Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours, ...   And he took the road for God knows in the morning   | The Pogues (Sally MacLennane)  
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away, And some people left for heaven without warning | The Pogues (Sally MacLennane)
Sad to say I must be on my way, So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away), I'd like to think of me returning when I can To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane   | The Pogues (Sally MacLennane) ++1
Now the song is nearly over, We may never find out what it means.  But there's a light I hold before me, And you're the measure of my dreams | The Pogues (Rainy Night in Soho) 
Did you keep a watch for a dead man's wind, Did you see the woman with the comb in her hand, Wailing away on the wall on the strand As you danced to the Turkish song of the damned | The Pogues (Turkish Song of the Damned) ++1

Thousands are sailing Across the Western Ocean, To a land of opportunity That some of them will never see | The Pogues (Thousands are Sailing)
May the ghosts that howled Round the house at night Never keep you from your sleep, May they all sleep tight Down in hell tonight Or where ever they may be | The Pogues (Lullaby of London)
May the wind that blows from haunted graves Never bring you misery, May the angels bright Watch you tonight And keep you while you sleep | The Pogues (Lullaby of London)

A book you finish reading is not the same book it was before you read it.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
Dreams are shores where the ocean of spirit meets the land of matter.  Dreams are beaches where the yet-to-be, the once-were, the will-never-be may walk awhile with the still are.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)  ++1
I feel sad that I found what I searched for, but no longer want what I found.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
She let him finish her sentences for her for so long that now he starts them too.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
This is my moral.  Trust what you dream.  Not what you think.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
You look for your meaning.  You find it, and at that moment, your meaning changes, and you have to start all over again.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
Do soldiers feel this, when they get back from a war?  The utter weirdness of utter normality.   | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)

"It was only a wasp," I say, "there are plenty more where they came from." This is not good enough for Tomomi: "There are plenty more humans where we come from, so does that make homicide okay?"
| David Mitchell (Number9Dream)

Mrs.Comb tightened her headscarf and wondered why human beings despise what is beautiful and good, and seek to destroy the things they need the most.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
The purpose of modern warfare is to slay as many civilians as possible.  | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
Nightmares are messengers, sent by who, or what, we really are, underneath.  "Don't forget where you come from," the nightmare tells us.  "Don't forget your true self." | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
Be careful of vacations in paradise.  You think too much about all the things you never did and never will do.   | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)
I realize that I have left Yakushima too, without ever meaning to.  Life never labels the last time you do something.   | David Mitchell (Number9Dream)

"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat." |  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz)
As long as there was tea, there was England.|  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz)
That's one trouble about the raids. . .   People do nothing but make tea and expect you to drink it.  |  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz)
"It would be foolish to disguise the gravity of the hour," he said.  "It would be still more foolish to lose heart and courage." |  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz)
If we can't be safe, let us at least be comfortable. |  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz)
Churchill's great trick -- one he had demonstrated before, and would demonstrate again -- was his ability to deliver dire news and yet leave his audience feeling encouraged and uplifted.  |  Erik Larson (The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz) ++1
You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing!  Depart, I say, and let us have done with you!  In the name of God, go!  | Leo Amery to Neville Chamberlain  
 
Do they sense it, these dead writers, when their books are read?  Does a pinprick of light appear in their darkness?  Is their soul stirred by the feather touch of another mind reading theirs?  I do hope so, for it must be very lonely being dead. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale) ++1
Once upon a time there was a fairy godmother, but the rest of the time there was none.  This story is about one of those other times. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)
One needs no particular talent to be polite.  On the contrary, being nice is what's left when you've failed at everything else. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale) 
She was a do-gooder, which means that all the ill she did, she did without realizing it. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)
A birth is not really a beginning.  Our lives at the start are not really our own but only the continuation of someone else's story. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)
No matter how banal the contents, there is always something that touches me.  For someone now dead once thought these words significant enough to write them down. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)
For nearly sixty years I have eavesdropped with impunity on the lives of people who do not exist. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)
There can be no secrets in a house where there are children. | Diane Setterfield (The Thirteenth Tale)

"Repository," he finally says, "you know this word?  A resting place.  A text -- a book -- is a resting place for the memories of people who have lived before." | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land) 
But books, like people, die.  They die in fires or floods or in the mouths of worms or at the whims of tyrants.  If they are not safeguarded, they go out of the world.  And when a book goes out of the world, the memory dies a second death.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land) ++1
Sometimes the things we think are lost are only hidden, waiting to be rediscovered.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
What you already have is better than what you so desperately seek.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
We are all beautiful even as we are all part of the problem, and that to be a part of the problem is to be human.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
The things that look fixed in the world, child -- mountains, wealth, empires -- their permanence is only an illusion.  We believe they will last, but that is only because of the brevity of our own lives.  From the perspective of God, cities like this come and go like anthills.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land) ++2
Forgetting, he is learning, is how the world heals itself.  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
In a life you accumulate so many memories, your brain constantly winnowing through them, weighing consequence, burying pain, but somehow by the time you're this age you still end up dragging a monumental sack of memories behind you, a burden as heavy as a continent, and eventually it becomes time to take them out of the world. | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land) ++2
The world as it is is enough. | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
He that knows all that Learning ever writ, knows only this -- that he knows nothing yet | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
"You and I will never reach Beta Oph2, dear, and that is a painful truth.  But in time you will come to believe that there is nobility in being a part of an enterprise that will outlast you."   | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
What's so beautiful about a fool is that a fool never knows when to give up. | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
Every lost book, before it vanished forever, got down to one final copy somewhere. | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
I am Aethon, a simple shepherd from Arkadia, and the tale I have to tell is so ludicrous, so incredible, that you'll never believe a word of it -- and yet, it's true | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
Aethon saw that the cities on both sides of the page, the dark ones and the bright ones, were one and the same, that there is no peace without war, no life without death, and he was afraid. | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land)
"When all you have is a shard of papyrus with a few words on it," Rex says, "or a single line quoted in somebody else's text, the potential of what's lost haunts you.  It's like the boys who died in Korea.  We grieve them the most because we never saw the men they would become."  | Anthony Doerr (Cloud Cuckoo Land) ++2

If you could remember that, it made you less angry.  They'd been carried along on their hopes, held up by the chance of a windfall. But instead of a windfall there was only time passing.  | Lydia Millet (A Children's Bible) ++1   
What people wanted to be, but never could, traveled along beside them.  Company. | Lydia Millet (A Children's Bible)
Scientists said it was ending now, philosophers said it had always been ending.  Historians said there'd been dark ages before.  It all came out in the wash, because eventually, if you were patient, enlightenment arrived and then a wide array of Apple devices. | Lydia Millet (A Children's Bible) ++1
Had they had goals once?  A simple sense of self-respect?  They shamed us.  They were a cautionary tale.  | Lydia Millet (A Children's Bible)

Not one of them has ever said: "This man is really something!  Everywhere there is a robbery, a domestic problem, a fight between neighbors, this man happens to be walking by!  Is he Batman or what?"  | Megha Majumdar (A Burning) 
Many years ago I would have been asking why is this happening? But now I am knowing that there is no use asking these questions. In life, many things are happening for no reason at all. | Megha Majumdar (A Burning)
If the police didn't help ordinary people like you and me, if the police watched them die, doesn't that mean, I wrote on Facebook, that the government is also a terrorist? | Megha Majumdar (A Burning)

while the blacks and Latinos who cleaned the apartments and dragged out the trash and made the music and filled the jails with sorrow slept the sleep of the invisible and functioned as local color.  | James McBride (Deacon King Kong) ++1
He’s a drunk.  One of those guys who dies at twenty and is buried at eighty. | James McBride (Deacon King Kong)
Deacon Cuffy Lambkins of Five Ends Baptist Church became a walking dead man on a cloudy September afternoon in 1969. | James McBride (Deacon King Kong)

But reality creeps in wherever you live, however pretty the flowers are, however blue the sky, however great the parties.  The only people who actually live in dreams are people in comas. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
If a song plants an idea or a feeling in a mind, it has already changed the world. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
Making art is already a political act.  The artist rejects the dominant version of the world.  The artist proposes a new version.  A subversion.  It's there in the etymology.  Tyrants are right to fear art. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue)  ++1
If you want to do something, do it.  Cause your turn to be in that box, it's coming.  No doctor, no diet, no nothing'll keep it away.  It'll be here.   | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
For a brief spell, we share a stage.  Others are coming to kick us off.  But while you're here, write yourself a good part.  Act it well. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
That's the paradox.  Utopia is unattainble.  Avenues are everywhere. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
True love is the act of trying to love.  Effortless love is as dubious as effortless gardening | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
Suffering is the one promise life always keeps. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
If reason worked on alcoholics, there'd be no alcoholics. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 
Grief is the bill of love, fallen due. | David Mitchell (Utopia Avenue) 

People often felt the need to prepare a side of themselves to display to passersby -- as they might in a store window, and that such display needn't be taken so seriously once the moment had passed. | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun) ++1
When we were new, we used to worry that because we often couldn't see the Sun from mid-store, we'd grow weaker and weaker. | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun) 
Our generation still carry the old feelings.  A part of us refuses to let go.  The part that wants to keep believing there's something unreachable inside each of us.  Something that's unique and won't transfer.  | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun) ++1
Even so, I believe there's still hope.  I believe help might come from a place the adults haven't yet considered.  | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun)
This is a strange tactic you're adopting here.  Favoritism, like any other form of corruption, works best when it remains unacknowledged. | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun)
-- What was becoming clear to me was the extent to which humans, in their wish to escape loneliness, made maneuvers that were very complex and hard to fathom | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun)
And I could see the weariness in the boy AF's walk, and wondered what it might be like to have found a home and yet to know that your child didn't want you. | Kazuo Ishiguro (Klara and the Sun)

People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day. | A.A. Milne (Winnie the Pooh)
Rivers know this: there is no hurry.  We shall get there some day.  | A.A. Milne (Winnie the Pooh)
You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think  | A.A. Milne (Winnie the Pooh)

No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality. | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) 
Am I walking toward something I should be running away from? | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) 
Don't do it, Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your cup of stars; once they have trapped you into being like everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again.  | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) ++1
Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone. | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) 
Nothing is ever really wasted, she believed sensibly, even one's childhood, and then each year, one summer morning, the warm wind would come down the city street where she walked and she would be touched with the little cold thought: I have let more time go by.  | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House)  ++2
It was a house without kindness, never meant to be lived in, not a fit place for people or for love or for hope.  Exorcism cannot alter the countenance of a house;  Hill House would stay as it was until it was destroyed. | Shirley Jackson (The Haunting of Hill House) ++1
